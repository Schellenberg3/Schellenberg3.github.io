	<h1>Hi there, I'm Andrew Schellenberg! Welcome to my website.</h1>
	<p>Thanks for checking out my website. I'm building this with GitHub Pages. It might be a <em>bit</em> sparse at the moment... but check back soon and I promise that there will be more! <strong>Until then, you can take a look at the cool projects on <a href="https://github.com/Schellenberg3/">my GitHub</a>.</strong></p>
	<p>I am presently working on my Master's thesis. It's focused on computer voxelized reconstructions and sensor sampling strategies. You can view that project <a href="https://github.com/Schellenberg3/ForgeScan">here</a>. I also did an undergraduate thesis on imitation learning for robotic policies, you can find that <a href="https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/92450">thesis</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/Schellenberg3/DISL_End_to_End_Learning">source code</a>.</p>
