    <p>I am a robotics researcher specializing in computer vision and autonomous systems. Environmental perception is foundational for decision-making in complex environments: my work develops novel approaches to solve mapping problems and generate digital twins of real-world locations and objects.</p>

    <p>I believe in developing simple, elegant solutions to practical problems. Above all, I strive to make technology that is useful and accessible. I am a proponent of open-source technology; you may find much of my work on <a href="https://github.com/Schellenberg3/">my GitHub</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Presently, I am a master's student at <a href="https://cdme.osu.edu/aims-lab">Artificially Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (AIMS)</a> Lab at Ohio State.</p>
    
    <p>Some of my research interests include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🧠 Machine learning and reinforcement learning</li>
        <li>📸 Image processing and computer vision</li>
        <li>👁️‍🗨️ Visuomotor control of robotics</li>
        <li>🔁 Sim-to-real transfer</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Please reach out and say hi! I'm always excited to talk about my project and find ways to collaborate.</p>
