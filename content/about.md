## Hi, I'm Andrew

I am a robotics researcher specializing in computer vision and autonomous systems. Environmental perception is foundational for decision-making in complex environments: my work develops novel approaches to solve mapping problems and generate digital twins of real-world locations and objects.

I believe in developing simple, elegant solutions to practical problems. Above all, I strive to make technology that is useful and accessible. I am a proponent of open-source technology; you may find much of my work on GitHub.

Presently, I am a master's student at [Artificially Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (AIMS) Lab](https://cdme.osu.edu/aims-lab) at Ohio State.

Some of my research interests include:

- 🧠 Machine learning and reinforcement learning
- 📸 Image processing and computer vision
- 👁️‍🗨️ Visuomotor control of robotics
- 🔁 Sim-to-real transfer

Please reach out and say hi! I'm always excited to talk about my project and find ways to collaborate.
