I am a C++ and Python developer doing applied research in robotics. How computers interact, observe, and represent the physical world fascinates me. My work intersects with machine vision, computational geometry, controls, and more.
There exists a near-infinite number of programming blogs. Hopefully, these ideas will inspire others working at the intersection of robotics and computer vision. It is not my intent to add noise or repeat hello world examples.</description></item><item><title>CV</title><link>schellenberg.3.github.io/cv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2023 21:28:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>schellenberg.3.github.io/cv/</guid><description>Thank you for taking an interest in my skills.

Environmental perception is foundational for decision-making in complex environments: my work develops novel approaches to solve mapping problems and generate digital twins of real-world locations and objects.
I believe in developing simple, elegant solutions to practical problems. Above all, I strive to make technology that is useful and accessible. I am a proponent of open-source technology; you may find much of my work on GitHub.</description></item></channel></rss>
